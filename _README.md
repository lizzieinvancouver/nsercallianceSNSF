## Work pages in SNSF and Wolkovich lab role (these are direct quotes)
WP1) How do patterns of masting and co-masting and their consequences on annual growth vary among co-occurring tree species?  (Characterizing masting through temporal patterns in reproduction and growth)

Xiaomao Wang will collect 2 increment cores from 10 trees per focal species per site in fall of 2025 (same individuals as monitored for seed production). These efforts benefit from earlier studies by PI Hille Ris Lambers over a decade ago (Ettinger et al. 2011; Ettinger & HilleRisLambers 2013; HilleRisLambers et al. 2015), providing preliminary data (those growth time series do not overlap sufficiently with seed production time series for our purposes). Once collected, cores will be stored in straws, brought back to Project Partner Wolkovich’s lab, mounted, and scanned (after sanding) to quantify species and individual tree specific annual growth. To capture tree growth for the last two years of the grant, we will also install point dendrometers on each tree prior to the growing season (in 2025). Although dendrometers are not strictly necessary for quantifying annual growth for proposed work (we could core trees in fall of 2027), coring early in the grant allows us to start data analyses earlier. Moreover, permanently mounted dendrometers are an investment for future studies, and build long-term data to understand how growth-reproduction relationships may shift in the future with climate change (including the effects of sub-annual disturbances such as frost, heat waves or drought).

We plan to employ a Bayesian hierarchical approach for WP1 (and all work packages), which both PIs have experience with (e.g. HilleRisLambers et al. 2009; Ettinger et al. 2020; Wolkovich et al. 2021). 

WP2) Does the fate of seeds, and the effects of seed consumers on those seeds, follow EOS predictions from masting theories (greater recruitment and lower loss to consumers in mast years)? Is  higher mortality in dense seedling patches (Janzen-Connell effects) a recruitment ‘cost’ of masting? (Do hypothesized EOS operate, and are seed predators or pathogens responsible?)

WP3) Do the demographic benefits of masting outweigh the costs across species in our forest communities? Can those costs and benefits be predicted by masting characteristics and / or the characteristics of seed consumers?  (The Demographic Costs and Benefits of the Mast Seeding Strategy)


Team and Roles from grant: INCLUDES budget info....

Project partner Wolkovich will mentor the UBC PhD and Masters students, and help coordinate the US seed predation and seed pathogen field and lab work (US field sites are just across the border from Vancouver, where UBC is located). Her extensive experience with hierarchical Bayesian modeling and relevant topics (tree growth, temporal dynamics, evolutionary constraints) will be essential for proposed work, as well as in supporting some logistical aspects of the US field work. 

Base funding to Project partner Wolkovich supports PhD student Xiaomao Wang. We anticipate that an NSERC-Alliance International Collaboration Grant (provided to Canadian collaborators in successful SNF grants, project partner Wolkovich) will provide funding for international team meetings, the UBC Masters student, research assistants for US field and lab work, US dendrometers, and sequencing for US soils.
